Experiment with these programs! Make certain you save the original program lists
(assuming they work correctly!) and then begin to explore by changing colors,
vertices, etc. Can you create a more complex object? Try it! There are many
different parameters for glBegin() other than GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, and
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN. These include GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINE_STRIP,
GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_QUADS, GL_QUAD_STRIP, and
GL_POLYGON. Research glBegin and see what you can find out about these
paramters. You can build amazingly complex shapes and objects using glBegin!
At this point in your journey you have the skills to create original works and ideas.
Now is your chance! Write a program using these new concepts with
pyilliOct.py, pyGermanBell.py, or pyilliTorus.py as models!
